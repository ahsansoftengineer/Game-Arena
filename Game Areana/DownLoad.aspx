This result is derived from our own experiences of testing thousands of games. So we will highly recommend Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit our gamers community. So that there games are always error free. Please make sure that you have installed all latest updates. Because ome newest files are dependent on Windows Updates fixes as well.

    Secondly please not that 32 bit x86 machines are not good for heavy games. Because they only support 4GB of RAM. Wheras most of the recent games requre upto 8GB recommended RAM. Therefore please always install x64 version of Windows. So that you can upgrade RAM Later if you want. We Recommend 8GB RAM and Windows 7 x64 for good experience.
